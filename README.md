# Customer Churn Prediction App

## Overview

This project is a machine learning application that predicts customer churn for a banking service. The application uses a neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras to analyze customer data and predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
- **Machine Learning Model**: Neural network with 2 hidden layers (64 and 32 neurons)
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automated handling of categorical variables and feature scaling
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant churn probability calculations
